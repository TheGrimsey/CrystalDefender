# CrystalDefender
#### 2D game about defending a crystal.

This game was a quick demo put together for class. It is far from a complete game (in comparison to SimpleFPS). I haven't spent a weekend crunching together features for this.

The concept for this game came partially from Dungeon Defenders, a fantastic tower defense game.

If I return to this in the future there are a few changes I would make:
1. Remove the PlayerInput class and just put the input functions in their respective classes.
2. Add in more traps.
3. Add more depth to the trap system. Probably moving to have some currency or resource for building traps.
4. Add in more UI for displaying information about the game state.
5. Add some depth to the combat system. Bows or other ranged things would be nice.
6. Polish the graphics. There should be more animations.

*I am not a fan of the Unity UI system. It is a hassle to make quick widgets.*
